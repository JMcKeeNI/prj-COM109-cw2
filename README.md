## Assignment Specification

You are required to work in small groups to develop a contemporary and accessible website that includes a Web Form to validate contact and other details. The website should contain multiple pages.

Students are required to apply the key concepts and methods covered during the module HTML,
CSS, JavaScript and relevant frameworks (such as jQuery) to implement dynamic interactive design and event-handling techniques (for example, animation, image effects, extensive form validation,etc.).

Students will incorporate the knowledge of UX design and apply the principles to develop the HTML structure to consider interactivity, accessibility features, as well as including coding for validation of user input.

The website should be standards-compliant and is capable of gathering and conditioning data supplied by a user. Users should be able to browse all the information. Dynamic interactive design and event handling techniques (for example, animations, banners, image effects, date/time, form validation, calculator, and cookies/LocalStorage) are required.

Each group is to submit a summary PDF report of the design (1800 words per team member) and will also submit a Zip file containing copies of the markup and code completed for the assignment.
